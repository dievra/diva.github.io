## Why the name STYX ?

In Greek mythology STYX is the name of the River or Swamp that forms the boundary between Earth and the Underworld.
Several names out of the cardano ecosystem are derived from ancient Greek mythology :


- Daedalus : Official wallet of Cardano platform   /   skillful craftsman and artist /  Daedalus the father of Icarus
- Icarus : Icarus is a reference implementation for a lightweight wallet. Yoroi is the first to use the reference./   Son of Daedalus
- Ourobouros : Proof of stake protocol (originated in ancient Egyptian iconography but entered western tradition via Greek magical tradition
- Plutus : Plutus is a strictly typed pure functional programming language used for defining smart contracts in Cardano /Plutus (Ploutos, literally "wealth") was the god of wealth in ancient Greek religion and Greek mythology.

We thought it would be cool to continue that tradition. That's how we came up with the name STYX.
